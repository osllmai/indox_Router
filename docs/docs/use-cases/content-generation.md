# Content Generation with IndoxRouter

IndoxRouter provides access to powerful language models that can be used for a wide range of content generation tasks. This guide demonstrates various content generation use cases and how to implement them.

## Text Generation Basics

At its core, content generation involves prompting a language model to produce text that meets specific requirements. Here's a simple example:

```python
from indoxrouter import Client

client = Client(api_key="your_api_key")

# Generate a short blog post
response = client.chat(
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a professional blog writer with expertise in technology."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a 300-word blog post about the impact of AI on content creation."}
    ],
    model="openai/gpt-4o"
)

blog_post = response["data"]
print(blog_post)
```

## Creative Writing

Language models can generate creative content like stories, poems, and scripts:

```python
# Generate a short story
story_response = client.chat(
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a creative fiction writer with a talent for engaging narratives."},
        {"role": "user", "content": (
            "Write a short story (around 500 words) about a scientist who discovers "
            "a way to communicate with plants. The story should have a surprising twist ending."
        )}
    ],
    model="anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229",
    temperature=0.8  # Higher temperature for more creativity
)

story = story_response["data"]
```

## SEO Content Creation

Generate SEO-optimized content for websites and marketing:

```python
# Generate SEO-optimized article

            "that ranks well in search engines. Include appropriate headings (H2, H3), "
            "bullet points where relevant, and a conclusion."
        )},

## Best Practices for Content Generation

1. **Iterative Refinement**: Generate a draft, then refine it with additional prompts
2. **Specific Instructions**: Provide clear, detailed instructions about tone, style, and format
3. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate model based on the content complexity
4. **Temperature Control**: Use higher temperature for creative content, lower for factual content
5. **Content Verification**: Always review AI-generated content for accuracy and appropriateness
6. **A/B Testing**: Generate multiple versions and test their effectiveness
7. **Human Touch**: Add human editing to enhance and personalize the content
